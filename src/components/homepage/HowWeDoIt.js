They might begin their research on a mobile device and then return to your site later to make a purchase or complete a contact form via their desktop. What if your desktop site doesn’t match the look and feel of your mobile site? You might end up losing the sale. With responsive design, you ensure your customers will get a consistent experience across all devices.</strong></p>
